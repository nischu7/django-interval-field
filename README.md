django-interval-field
=====================

as opposed to the original project, this fork focuses on relativedelta support using dateutil.relativedelta and psycopg2_dateutils (which makes psycopg2 return relativedelta instead of timedelta objects).

Moreover Python 3 is supported (and Python 2.x isn't anymore, I guess)

The tests haven't been fixed yet!
